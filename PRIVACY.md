PRO ChatGPT Chrome Extension runs locally in your browser. It does not use third‑party analytics or tracking and does not sell personal data.

## Data We Store
- **OpenAI API key** — stored via Chrome's `storage.sync` so you can use the extension on your signed‑in Chrome profiles.
- **Prompt presets** — stored via `storage.sync`.

## Data We Send
- **Prompts and selected/visible page text** — sent to OpenAI only when you explicitly ask a question or click “Summarize Page,” in order to generate a response.
- We do **not** send data anywhere else.

## Permissions
The extension requests permissions only to implement the features described (inline panel, summaries, context menu). See `permissions_rationale.md` in the repository for a detailed explanation.

## Contact
For questions or requests, please open an issue on the project's GitHub repository.
